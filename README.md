# blackJack

So here is my first project on github, that's a really simple and small blackJack game.
It was a project for my computer science class in high school so all variable, fonction name and print stuff are in french.
I'm planning to translate it to English quickly and later maybe turn it into a graphic game.

To launch the game just execute with python the blackJack.py file, "banque.py" is here only for storing the data of the wallet
