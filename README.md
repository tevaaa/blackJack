# blackJack

So here is my first project on github, that's a really simple and small blackJack game.
It was a project for my computer science class in high school so all variable, fonction name and print stuff are in french.
Later maybe i could add a GUI.

To launch the game just execute with python the blackJack.py file, "banque.py" is here only for storing the data of the wallet
